# Code Style Guide

These guidelines reflect the preferred coding style for this project and should be applied to future projects as well.

## 1. One File for One Component/Function
*   **Single Responsibility**: Each file should contain only one component or one interface. Multiple interfaces are allowed if they are to combine into one type.
*   **File Name**: File name should be exactly the same as the root component or root interface.
*   **File Size**: Keep file sizes small. Ideally under 60 lines, strictly under 100 lines.
*   **Split Large Files**: Components growing beyond 100 lines must be split into smaller sub-components or hooks.

## 2. Comments
*   **No Comments Allowed**: Do not write comments in the code (no `//` or `/* */`).
*   **Self-Documenting Code**: If you feel the need to explain a block of code with a comment, you must instead refactor the code to make it self-explanatory.
    *   **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes that explain *what* they are and *why* they exist.
    *   **Extraction**: Extract complex logic into small, reasonably named helper functions.
    *   **Types**: Use explicit TypeScript types and interfaces to clarify data structures instead of documenting them.

## 3. Inline Logic & Anonymous Functions
*   **Inline Logic**: For functions only used once in one place, do not name or create them. Write the code directly in the place of use (e.g., inside the event handler prop).
*   **Avoid Named One-Off Functions**: Strictly avoid naming functions that are only used once.
*   **Conciseness**: Prefer arrow functions and concise syntax.

## 4. Code Quality & Linting
*   **Zero Warnings**: The codebase must remain free of linting warnings and errors.
*   **No Unused Code**: Strictly remove all unused variables, imports, types, and parameters.
*   **Dead Code**: Do not comment out code for later use; delete it.

## 5. File & Folder Structure
*   **Feature-Based Organization**: Group code by feature (e.g., `screen`, `mouse`) rather than technical role. Avoid generic top-level folders like `core`, `utils`, or `components`.
*   **No "Core" Modules**: specific types, constants, and logic should reside in their respective feature folders.
*   **Co-location**: Keep related types (`Point.ts`), constants, and sub-components within the feature folder they belong to.

## 6. Naming & Files
*   **Meaningful Filenames**: Avoid generic filenames like `constants.ts`, `config.ts`, or `types.ts`. Use specific names that describe the content (e.g., `server.ts` for server configuration, `Rect.ts` for Rect interface).
*   **Function-File Match**: The name of the main exported function or type should match the filename (e.g., `useDebounce` inside `useDebounce.ts`, `ViewportState` inside `ViewportState.ts`).
*   **Separate Type Files**: Define interfaces and types in their own separate files. Do not bundle them.
*   **Co-location**: Place type files in the directory where they are primarily used.

## 7. Formatting & Readability
*   **Indentation**: Use **2 spaces** for indentation.
*   Prioritize clarity over brevity.
*   Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

## 8. CSS Files
*   **Plain CSS**: Plain CSS file of the same name as the component (e.g., `Screen.css` for `Screen.tsx`).
*   **Native Nesting**: Use native CSS nesting to scope styles.
*   **Root Class**: The root element of a component must have a class name that strictly follows the file path convention:
    *   Top-level: `App` for `App.tsx`.
    *   Nested: `[folder]-[Component]` (e.g., `screen-Screen` for `src/screen/Screen.tsx`).
*   **Inner Classes**: Use simple, descriptive names for inner elements (e.g., `.image`), strictly nested within the root class.

## 9. Simplicity & Cleanup
*   **Active Cleanup**: Always revert debug logging, temporary test code, and unused artifacts immediately after verifying a fix. The codebase should remain clean at all times.
*   **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Do not use complex APIs (like `URLSearchParams`) when a simple string construction sufficies.
*   **Minimal Abstraction**: Use the simplest possible solution that solves the problem.

## 10. Concise Logic
*   **Immutability**: Avoid `let` and mutation. Use `const` chains to transform data step-by-step (e.g., `filter` -> `sort` -> `slice`).
*   **Functional Iteration**: Prefer `.map`, `.filter`, and other array methods over traditional `for` loops.
*   **Nullish Coalescing**: Prefer `??` over `||` for default values to strictly handle `null`/`undefined` without suppressing falsy values (e.g. `0`, `""`).
