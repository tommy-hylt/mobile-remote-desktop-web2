- Please read design idea in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)

## Development Guidelines
- [ ] **Automated Testing**: verified with `npm run build` and `npm run lint` (if available) before handing over work.
- [ ] **Shell Usage**: Always use `cmd /c` for commands instead of PowerShell directly. PowerShell often blocks execution due to security policies in this environment.

## Verification Checklist
- Build success: `npm run build`
- Lint success: `npm run lint`
